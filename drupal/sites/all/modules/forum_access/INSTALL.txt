To install this module, simply put the entire forum_access directory into
your modules directory or sites/all/modules directory and activate it.

This module requires the ACL module API and will not activate without it.

After you've installed Forum Access, go to admin/content/forum, click on an
'edit forum' link and set Access Control for the selected forum.
Repeat this for every other forum.
