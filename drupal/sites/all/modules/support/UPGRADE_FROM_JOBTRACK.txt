This module was formerly known as "jobtrack", but was renamed due to a possible
trademark infrigmenet: http://drupal.org/node/469210

If you are upgrading from 'jobtrack' to 'support', you need to follow these
directions.  If you are installing 'support' for the first time, then you
can ignore the contents of this file.

-----

1) Make a backup of your database.
   Play it safe!  Something may go wrong with the upgrade process, and this way
   you don't risk permantently losing important data.

2) Verify that your backup is valid.
   A backup is worthless if it doesn't work.  Test that you can restore your
   backup onto a development server.

3) Upgrade to jobtrack-6.x-1.6-rc1, the final JobTrack release.  This is a 
   mandatory step!  If you are running an older version of JobTrack and attempt
   to upgrade to the Support module things WILL break.  Be sure to run
   update.php after installing jobtrack-6.x-1.6-rc1.

   The final jobtrack release, 6.x-1.6-rc1, can be found here:
     http://drupal.org/node/468726

4) Disable the 'jobtrack' module (be sure you completed step #3 first).
   The jobtrack module is no longer necessary.

5) Enable the 1.0 version of the 'support' module.

   The support module replaces the jobtrack module.  When you enable the
   module, it will automatically your tickets from jobtrack-6.x-1.6-rc1 to the
   support module.   It is critical that you first install the original support
   module release, and then upgrade to the latest support module release
   afterwards.

6) Upgrade to the latest version of the 'support' module.
   http://drupal.org/project/support
   First installing the 1.0 version and then upgrading to the latest version
   will ensure that your database schema is fully up to date.

7) Go to "Administer >> User management >> Permissions" and set permissions.
   For more information about how permissions work, review INSTALL.txt.
   The names of permissions have changed, so you can not skip this step.

   Specifically, the following permissions have been removed: "administer
   state", "can assign tickets to other users", and "view ticket status bar".
   The following permissions have been added: "can select state", "can
   administer state", "can select priority", "can select client", "can assign
   tickets to self", and "can assign tickets to any user".
