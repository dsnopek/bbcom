Module: Webform Block
Author: Mike Carter <www.ixis.co.uk/contact>

Description
===========
Allows embedding a webform node into a block which can be positioned in any block
region (theme space permitting). Handles redirecting back to the current page on
validation errors.

Good use for this is to add a site wide contact form inline on your pages, such
as in the footer or sidebar.


Installation
============
Activate the module as usual. You'll need the webform
(http://drupal.org/project/webform) module available too.


Usage
=======
Create or edit a webform node. Expand the 'webform advanced settings' section and
tick the 'Generate a block' option.

You'll now find your webform appears as a block under the block admin list. If you
edit the block there is also a link back to the webform node so that you can edit
the fields quickly and easily.
