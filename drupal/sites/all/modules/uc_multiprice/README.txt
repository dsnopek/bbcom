A basic but powerfull module for Ubercart that allows to overide the product price based on a country.
The module provides a block where the user can select a country/region. This selection is then used to select the correct price.

If enabled it will use ip2cc module or ip2country to get the country code from the user by IP. (block selection will overide this).
