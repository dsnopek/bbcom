lingwo-fields-view-pl-adjective.tpl.php:

  * We should show the forms that can be table-ized in a table the same way they are on the
    edit entry page.  We should try and make these templates shared between the "view" and "widget"
    templates somehow.  This probably involves making the template variables the same.  Maybe even
    creating new theme functions for the "pretty data" that we can just theme('pretty', ...) on.

  * We should show the rest of the forms somehow.  I'm not sure what to do, because we want to be
    able to see all the forms in case something weird is up (like an exception set where there really
    shouldn't be an exception) but I don't want to clutter the node up with useless data, especially,
    when senses comes after fields and it is a much more useful field when on the View tab.  Here are
    some options that should be considered with UI ease above everything else:

    - Have an additional forms tab.

    - Put the rest of the forms in an expandable area, so that they are only shown if asked for.

    - Put them below the senses.

  * Exceptions (meaning non-automatic fields) need to be marked especially clearly.  This will 
    probably turn up where ever we decide to list all forms.

  * Fields not taken into account by the template should be rendered somewhere.  Not entirely
    sure how to do this when we aren't using drupal_render() for the individual fields.  But it
    is essential for admin/editor type people to be able to see all set fields on an entry.  For
    example, it doesn't make sense for a normal user to see "Soft" on an adjective, but it does
    make sense for an administrator to see it, since an adjective improperly marked soft could
    cause problems in the dictionary.
