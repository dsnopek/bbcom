 * For everything in "lingwo_dictionary" which doesn't require JavaScript, we will test using
   Drupal's SimpleTest.  I believe this is best since that code will be Open Source and living
   on Drupal.org, so it needs to follow The Drupal Way.
 
 * For the bits that need JavaScript (ie. "lingwo_korpus", "lingwo_fields") we will write the
   tests in Python/Selenium 2.0 and they will live here.  I'll consider moving it to those packages
   at some later date.  But this code will be Open Source and still allow us to test stuff before
   it is commited.
 
 * For the bits that are specific to BiblioBird, we will also test them here, in Python/Selenium 2.0.

 * If it were eventually possible to replace the SimpleTest internal browser with Selenium 2.0, then we
   should do that!  And, of course, move the "lingwo_korpus" and "lingwo_fields" tests to live with
   them.
