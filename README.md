BiblioBird.com site specific code
=================================

BiblioBird.com is based on Drupal 6.  All of our customizations to Drupal are contained here in 
the *modules* directory.  Our theme lives in the *theme* directory.

The server-side portions of our Anki integration live in the *AnkiServer* directory.

This is also home to number of scripts and notes (most of them drastically out-of-date).

I hope in the future to clean this up.  I have been the only user of this repo for a **long**
time!  It could use some work getting ready for the work of others.
