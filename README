Here we will eventually have something like the following modules:

 * lingwoorg: Small hacks that are specific to lingwoorg and not to any other psuedo generic modules

 * lingwoorg_dictionary: For tying together all the dictionary functionality.

 * lingwoorg_wiki: For tying together all of the wiki functionality

 * lingwoorg_content: For tying together all the content syndication functionality together.

I'm not sure where the annotation, etc stuff should go: lingwoorg_dictionary or lingwoorg_content.  Maybe in both of them??

Anyway, this stuff is intended to allow us to easily setup test servers and deploy to production.
