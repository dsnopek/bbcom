Instructions for installing and running AnkiServer:

 1. First, you need to install "virtualenv".  If your system has easy_install, this is
    just a matter of:

      $ easy_install virtualenv

    If your system doesn't have easy_install, I recommend getting it!

 2. Next, you need to create a Python environment for running AnkiServer and install some of
    the dependencies we need there:

      $ virtualenv AnkiServer.env
      $ AnkiServer.env/bin/easy_install webob PasteDeploy PasteScript sqlalchemy simplejson MySQL-python

 3. Download and install libanki.  You can find the latest release of Anki here:

    http://code.google.com/p/anki/downloads/list 

    Look for a *.tgz file with a Summary of "Anki Source".  At the time of this writing
    that is anki-1.0.1.tgz.

    Download this file and extract.  Inside you will find a libanki/ directory with a
    setup.py.  You will want to run setup.py with the python executable inside our virtualenv,
    or AnkiServer.env/bin/python, like so:

      anki-1.0.1/libanki$ ../../AnkiServer.env/bin/python setup.py install

 4. Make the egg info files (so paster can see our app):

      $ AnkiServer.env/bin/python setup.py egg_info

 5. Then we can run AnkiServer like so:

      $ AnkiServer.env/bin/paster serve development.ini
