DDP
===

Development Process (DDP)

DDP is a method for rapidly collecting the lexemes of a previously undocumented language. It uses a list of 1800 semantic domains to help native speakers of a language to think of and write down the words and lexical phrases of their language. Each domain includes elicitation questions and sample words. Several hundred dictionary projects have used DDP to collect 10,000-25,000 lexemes in a two week workshop. The DDP materials have been incorporated into Fieldworks Language Explorer. Other software such as Toolbox and LexiquePro support DDP.
