In the future this module will provide:

 * Creating an anki deck node for all users WIAL list (once anki deck nodes exist)

 * The ability for users to share decks with other users (ie. find other decks and copy them
   to their own)
 
 * The tracking which 'Lingwo IDs' are present in each deck (for giving users suggestions for
   a particular deck, ie: "The 'Household Items' deck from _MasterSpanglish_ has 24 items from
   your WIAL list.  Buy now for $4.95!"
 
 * Integrating with ubercart to provide the afore-aluded-to purchasing of other users decks.

Right now (2010-01-26), what it does is:

 * Add/remove facts to a user's deck when entries are added/removed from a users WIAL list.
   (It will continue to do this in the future).

 * Provide some stand-in pages to allow users to access their WIAL flashcards and (maybe) quiz
   them.  (This will only be here until anki decks are actual nodes)
